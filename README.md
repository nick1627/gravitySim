# gravitySim

VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS

A simulation of how the gravity of large celestial bodies (stars, planets, moons) affects the motion of a small test body.

Eventually orbital maneouvres will be possible.  Essentially I want to be able to load in data for the positions of solar system bodies and then calculate "slingshot" maneouvres.

Will have to look into which variables to optimise and the best methods for optimising them.  I'm expecting hill-climbing type stuff.

Initially I'd like a graphical output of stuff, because it will make the debugging so much easier and I know what the maneouvres should look like in reality thanks to KSP.  For ease of graphical output, I may have to convert this into javascript or find out how to run python code on a webpage.
